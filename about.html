        <p>Marco Carola rose to prominence during the mid-‘90s on the back of material for his own Design Music and One Thousand Records imprint — reflecting the times, the releases on the latter imprint were ‘limited’ to 1000 units. Thanks to a series of
            key EPs on both labels, he came to define the hard-edged sound of European techno at the time. In contrast to the one-dimensional, looped releases that were flooding record stores during the latter part of the ‘90s, Carola’s approach was at
            times abrasive and visceral, inspired by the output of earlier Italian imprints like ACV, on other occasions, deep and dubbed out, influenced by German labels like Basic Channel, and at times inflected with Detroit stylings.</p>

        <p>What united all of Carola’s music during this time, however, was a rolling, club-primed sensibility that provided the fuel for his mindblowing three-deck sets. This combination meant that the Naples native soon became one of the world’s most in-demand
            underground DJs.<br> By the end of the ‘90s, Carola released his debut album, which saw him explore an increased range of styles, adding breakbeats and deep synths to his musical armoury. ‘Open System’, which followed in 2001, saw him further
            explore cerebral sounds, with a track like ‘State Of Mind’, for example, finding a path between steely electro and dreamy early ‘90s UK techno. However, the Italian DJ’s focus was never too far from the dancefloor, and with the onset of the
            new millennium, his love of stripped-back club music morphed towards minimal techno. This move culminated in the ‘Play It Loud!’ album, issued on Richie Hawtin’s M-nus label. Carola’s artistic shift saw his profile rise from the underground
            to dance music’s mainstream, and he became a regular feature at Sven Väth’s Cocoon nights in Ibiza.</p>
